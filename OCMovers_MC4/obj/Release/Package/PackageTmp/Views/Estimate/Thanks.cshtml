        <p>We have received your estimate request and information, and have also sent a copy to you. We will reply to you within 2 business days with a pricing estimate.</p>

        <p><strong>Important!:</strong> Our schedule changes DAILY, so when we do respond with an estimate it is very important that you respond as soon as possible to make sure that your request and approved move date is still available.

        <p>We will not schedule your move until we receive an approval from you.</p>

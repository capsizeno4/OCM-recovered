New email is ready:

http://mail.oldcitymovers.com
oldcitymovers@oldcitymovers.com / Oldcity76?

you can use either mail client, but Jon likes myWebmail.  click that to login.

I transferred all the emails last night, nothing was left over and everything should be up to date and formatted the way 

you guys like it.

If you guys have any trouble during the day, my Skype IM is eharms73. Im in front of my computer all day and is the best 

way to get me.  Otherwise email me eric.harms@gmail.com and Im usually pretty quick.  I do have a day job so if there is 

a fix needed it might take me a little bit to get it done.

Keep me posted as to how it goes getting emails, that they do come through, and things are working nicely.

Sell sell sell!!

Thanks!
Eric
